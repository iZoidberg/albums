Task:
Please take not more than 2 hours for solving the task. You can push it back to your github.

Build a ruby on rails application to manage your music album collection using test-driven development.
It should be possible to create a user account, to sign in and out and as a user to search your own albums.
For the albums users can upload covers which can be displayed in different sizes.
The implementation code should be so DRY, restful and resource-oriented and well-tested that a documentation is superfluous.
For testing we strongly recommend using rspec and either cucumber or steak/rspec request specs.
Focus on writing tests (more important than the actual app). Scaffolding isn't allowed.

Done:
Authentication with devise gem
Create, list, edit, delete albums

Not finished due to time limitation:
searching albums and picture upload

Tests are written with cucumber and rspec. Unfortunately I had not enough time. So the code coverage is bad.
Inserting albums and logging in is covered by a cucumber test. The album model is tested by rspec
(only the scope by_user).
